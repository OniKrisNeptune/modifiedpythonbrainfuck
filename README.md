# modifiedpythonbrainfuck
Usage: upon running the file, it will ask you for four things:

Memory size: 

Cell size: 

Code: 

Input: 

Memory size is the length on the memory(the amount of cells)

Cell size is the maximum value a cell can store (in base 10)

Code is where you put the brainfuck code, all characters other than the brainfuck code are ignored

input is where you write the input, in decimal and separated by spaces

This interpreter uses wrap around

to-do:

add a "Default" option, with 30000 memory size and 255 cell size

make it print out the amount of instructions executed

add proper error detection and messages

add infinite loop detection

add debug capabilities(running the code step by step etc)
